this is git private key.
when we do 
git set-url origin https:// username@token@github.com/repo.git

just do this and push and pull becomes easy.


in aws. let host be aws-server
hostname can be ip or public hostname
user can be ubuntu in most cases.
and then just connect. 

Remember that usualy, we need to remove all the groups and users from the file permitions of the 
.pem file. so just remove inherited properties and then remove them, them only it will allow that key to be 
used/
